            </h2>
            <p>
                <p>1. ICAMM 2025 reserves the right to select papers from the conference for publication in
                international journals.</p>
                <p>2. Upon a written request from the author, ICAMM 2025 can submit a paper to any
                international journal indexed in Scopus or SCI. In such cases, the author will be
                responsible for covering the full publication costs as per the journal&#39;s requirements. The
                review and publication process may take between 3 to 12 months.</p>
                <p>3. The ICAMM 2025 review process for associated international journals typically takes a
                minimum of 30 to 60 days to complete after the conference.</p>
                <p>4. The international journals associated with ICAMM 2025 are ISSN-approved.</p>
                <p>5. Authors who wish to receive a hard copy of the journal must cover the associated
                charges.</p>
                <p>6. The editorial board holds the right to reject any paper for publication in an international
                journal after the second round of review (post-conference). If a paper is rejected, the
                conference registration fee will not be refunded.</p>

                PLAGIARISM POLICY
            </h2>
            <p>
                <p>1. Authors are responsible for checking the plagiarism (below 25%) of their papers before
                submission. Authors who republish their previously published work (self-plagiarism) will
                be subject to the same procedures as outlined above.</p>
                <p>2. All research papers submitted for publication undergo plagiarism detection using
                specialized software to verify their originality and determine the similarity percentage.
                Papers that do not meet the required criteria will be returned to the author for revision.</p>
