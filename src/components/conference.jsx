                            held in the Department of Mathematics at PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore from
                            January 8â€“10, 2025. The conference aims to stimulate research and make a substantial
                            contribution to the advancement of computational and mathematical models. This is achieved by
                            offering a forum for the exchange of novel concepts and discussions of recent advancements in
                            the subject between scholars, researchers, students, and business professionals. Further, it would
                            provide a platform for outstanding research articles on mathematics&#39; theoretical foundations and
                            technological and engineering applications.</p>
